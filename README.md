# Next Blog Stater

Hello! This is a starter site for a NextJS blog. It's been built to use MDX,
Tailwind, and the App router. It's incredibly quick and easy to get started and
change it to fit your purposes.

Have a look at the [demo site here](https://nextjs-blog-starter-mu.vercel.app/), and read the
accompanying [blog post over here](https://patsnacks.com/blog/building-nextjs-blog-2024).

Out of the box it supports:

- 👨‍💻 MDX (with examples)
- ⏳ Auto releasing articles in the future
- 🔍 SEO and OpenGraph tags with OG examples
- 🏷️ Tagging posts and exploring by tags
- 🐦 Sharing posts on Twitter
- 🌕 Dark mode
- 📸 Photos example, with lightbox!
- 💭 Opinionated prettier setup

It's been licensed under MIT, so feel free to use it for whatever you like.

  existing one and changing the content for the first try.
