Hey there, you're reading my second post. It's pretty cool, right?

In the future I'm also going to add some other things to my blog such as

-   A recipe for a delicious pumpkin and zucchini bake
-   A review of the latest movie I've seen
-   A tutorial on how to make a website with React
-   <s>A fortune telling component</s> _done!_

## Discover your fortune...

<FortuneTeller />

export const metadata = metadataJson;

export default function MDXPage({children}) {
return <BlogLayout blogPostId={metadata.id}>{children}</BlogLayout>;
}
